The idea behind this development system is that the programmer must focus only on the program's functionality, in practice the development focuses on the creation of a library without a graphical interface and protocols that allow the front-end to interact with the back-end. Once the back-end is compiled and the assembly is produced, an AI analyzer examines it and automatically creates the front-end with all the iteration mechanisms with it. This speeds up development considerably. The front-end is created complete with everything, including field validation mechanisms. API and iteration systems between GUI and back-end.
In the various tutorials published, for convenience the front-end project coincides with the back-end, this to facilitate these examples, from the practical side it is possible to create a back-end project as a library (therefore without a GUI), and create separate projects for the generation of Web, Mobile and Desktop applications: We are working on 3 GUI generators that cover all the cases, in this way by writing a single back-end you will have the Web, Mobile and Desktop apps ready in one go.
