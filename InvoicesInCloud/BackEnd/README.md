## Invoice In Cloud (back-end)
### Invoicing and customer management software

"Invoice In Cloud back-end" is the smallest but most complete invoicing software. It is part of the demos of the potential of the front-end auto-generation tool (the GUI).
To see the final result you need to run the ["InvoiceInCloud"](https://github.com/Andrea-Bruno/Blazor-Auto-GUI-generator-samples/tree/master/InvoicesInCloud/FrontEnd) startup project (on this same repository) that contains the assembly analyzer and the GUI rendering engine.

The back-end is a library that contains all the logic of the software, without any reference to the GUI. The GUI is automatically generated by the front-end project, which is a separate project.

### Main Classes in the Back-end

- **Company**: Represents a company and contains information such as name, address, and VAT number.
- **Customer**: Manages customer data, including name, contacts, and address.
- **Invoice**: Models an invoice, with details such as number, date, customer, and list of items.
- **InvoiceItem**: Represents a single item within an invoice, with description, quantity, and price.
- **InvoiceHtmlGenerator**: Generates the HTML code to display an invoice.
- **Setup**: Contains the initial setup logic for the system.

### Panels

Panels are components that manage specific functionalities of the application:

- **BusinessEntity**: Manages business entities.
- **InvoiceArchive**: Manages the invoice archive.
- **InvoiceComposer**: Allows creating and editing invoices.
- **CustomerList**: Displays and manages the list of customers.

### Front-end Auto-Generation Technology

The magic of this project is due to the technology that allows automating the entire front-end generation. The front-end project analyzes the assemblies of the back-end and automatically generates the user interface (GUI) based on the classes and their attributes. This approach drastically reduces development time and ensures that the GUI is always synchronized with the back-end logic.

For example, the `ClassInfo` class in the front-end project uses reflection to analyze the back-end classes and dynamically create the UI components. This includes generating forms for data entry, tables for displaying lists, and much more.

In summary, "Invoice In Cloud" demonstrates how it is possible to create a complete invoicing and customer management application with minimal front-end development effort, thanks to the power of the GUI auto-generation technology.
